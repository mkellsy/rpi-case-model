# Raspberry Pi Case Assembly Instructions
This guide will walk you through assembling the Raspberry Pi case. All of the tools and hardware should be available at Amazon, Home Depot or Ace Hardware.

## Required Tools and Hardware
- A #6-32 tap.
- 7/64 and 3/32 hex wrench.
- 4 x #4-40 x 1/4 stainless socket head cap screws. (RPI 3 Version Only)
- 4 x #6-32 x 3/4 stainless socket head cap screws.

## Tapping
First you will need to tap the holes on the RPI-BOTTOM. Tapping is not required as the screws are harder than the plastic. However tapping will create a more consistant thread, as tapping removes material vs. compressing it.

## Assembly
Once you are finished printing the parts, you are now ready to assemble.

### Step 1
Attach the Raspberry Pi to the RPI-BOTTOM.

1. Allign the board to the 4 raisers on the RPI-BOTTOM.
2. Attach using 4 #4-40 x 1/4 stainless socket head cap screws. (RPI 3 Version Only)

  > #4-40 taps are hard to find. These screws will need to be self tapped.

### Step 2
Attach the RPI-TOP.

1. Allign the top with the four mount points on the RPI-BOTTOM.
2. Secure the RPI-TOP with 4 #6-32 x 3/4 stainless socket head cap screws.

## Assembly, Screwless Version (RPI 3 Version Only)
If you do not want to secure the Raspberry Pi into the case using screws, you can use the retainer and not use the screws.

> The RPI 4 version has the retainer built into the top.

### Step 1
Position the Raspberry Pi and the RPI-RETAINER in the RPI-BOTTOM.

1. Allign the board to the 4 raisers on the RPI-BOTTOM.
2. Place the RPI-RETAINER into the 4 raisers on the RPI-BOTTOM through the board.

  > One side of the retainer is offset. This is done to clear the pins on the Raspberry Pi.

### Step 2
Attach the RPI-TOP.
